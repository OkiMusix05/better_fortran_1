# Why Better FORTRAN?
I'm a Physics student who **loves** FORTRAN's speed but **hates** FORTRAN's syntax.
Therefore, I created this FORTRAN transpile that translates my custom scripting language (.BTF) to FORTRAN, so I can get the benefits and speed of FORTRAN while coding in a programming language I like more.
As I am a physics student and not a Computer Science student, and making a transpiler is really, really hard, this project literally just uses REGEX to translate lines, but it gets the job done wonderfully
# Version Log
- **v0.0**: Initial commit, the transpiler can take a path to a .BTF file and accurately translate the main program, comments, variable declarations including matrices, and prints.
- **v0.01**, **v0.011**: Repository initializer
